            On April 10, 1912, the Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage, traveling from Southampton, England, to New York City.
            Nicknamed the “Millionaire’s Special,” the ship was fittingly captained by Edward J. Smith, who was known as the
            “Millionaire’s Captain” because of his popularity with wealthy passengers. Indeed, onboard were a number of prominent
            people, including American businessman Benjamin Guggenheim, British journalist William Thomas Stead, and Macy’s
            department store co-owner Isidor Straus. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 was a catastrophic event
            which has since passed into myth and legend. But what is the truth behind the myth?<br> <br>

          Titanic is one of the highest grossing and most iconic Hollywood movies of the 20th century. The story of Jack and Rose
          is engrained in the memory of millions as the modern love story. However, people will probably be surprised as Jack and
          Rose are not even real. As we idolized over the movie, we don’t really understand the facts and figure behind the
          sinking of the RMS Titanic, one of the most tragic and influential sea disasters of the early 20th century.<br><br>
          And, you think you know the story.

          Through this interactive experience, we want to tell the story and pay our respects to those who perish in this tragic
          accident with the hope that their story will not only be a constant reminder of the need of proper safety procedure, but
          also the need for a more inclusive and fair society. As you scroll through the interactive graphs, we will layout facts
          and statistics of the accident which includes deep dive of the passenger and crew’s nationality, age, gender, social
          class and how these factors affect their survival. <br><br>

          In some of the graph, there will be "passenger", "crew", and "all" buttons. Click on these buttons to focus on those group
          of people.

              Gender inequality was a major problem back in the early 20th
              century as women often were not able to work or travel without permission without authorization from their husbands.
              Moreover, women are generally poorer as they were not able to get access to high paying jobs. We want to see how gender
              inequality back in the 1920s affected the passenger distribution of titanic. We see that there are far more males than
              females (in fact almost twice as much). Click here to see all passenger and crew: <button id = "all2"> all </button>

              Titanic was a passenger liner that operated between England and
              the United States. It carried some of the wealthiest people in Europe, but also at the same time carried immigrants into
              the US. It is thus no surprise that working age individuals (age 15 - 30) account for the majority of the passenger as
              the early 20th century was a time where European migration into the US was at a high due to wars and instability in
              Europe. Click here to see all passenger and crew: <button id = "all3"> all </button>

            In the 21st century, we are used to thinking that globalization and movement of people is a recent trend. However, it
            was because of early pioneer innovation such as Titanic that people can move almost anywhere they want and within
            reasonable time. We see that the Titanic had a very diverse set of nationalities. It not only had passengers from
            Europe, but also from far away places such as Asia and the middle east.
