        <div class="title">How many passengers on board?</div>
        This graph shows all of Titanic’s <h5>passengers</h5> and <h5>crews</h5>. As a homage to those who died, you can also hover over the dots
        to see their names. We believe that each of these persons deserve proper recognition and respect, regardless of their
        status, gender, age, and sex.
        <!-- <div class="note">* There were actually approx. 1317 passengers on board but this is the total in the data.</div> -->
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">There were more men than women on board.</div>
        This graph shows the gender distribution of the <h5>passengers</h5> and <h5>crews</h5>. Gender inequality was a major problem back in the early 20th
        century as women often were not able to work or travel without permission without authorization from their husbands.
        Moreover, women are generally poorer as they were not able to get access to high paying jobs. We want to see how gender
        inequality back in the 1920s affected the passenger distribution of titanic. We see that there are far more males than
        females (in fact almost twice as much).
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The majority were aged between 15 and 45 years old.</div>
        This graph shows the distribution of the <h5>passengers</h5> and <h5>crews</h5> age group distribution. Titanic was a passenger liner that operated between England and
        the United States. It carried some of the wealthiest people in Europe, but also at the same time carried immigrants into
        the US. It is thus no surprise that working age individuals (age 15 - 30) account for the majority of the passenger as
        the early 20th century was a time where European migration into the US was at a high due to wars and instability in
        Europe.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">There was a much larger proportion of passengers in 3rd class.</div>
        This graph shows the distribution of passenger class. Even though Titanic was infamous as one of the most luxurious
        ships back at its day, it actually made a lot of its earnings carrying poor immigrants from Europe to the US. The rooms
        and accomodation that these people had (3rd class passengers) were much less luxurious and often lacking. Data shows
        that there is a much larger proportion of 3rd class passengers compared to other classes, but 1st and 2nd class
        passenger numbers were similar.

        Women definitely had better odds than men.

        <div class="title">Passenger Age</div>
        Age isn't so significant but under 15's had the highest survival rate with 15-30s and over 70s had the lowest.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Passenger Class</div>
        Passengers in 3rd class had a significantly lower survival rate than those in 1st and 2nd class.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">1st and 2nd Class Children</div>
        And 1st and 2nd Class children (under 15) had the highest survival rate of them all.

       Women and Children travelling in 1st and 2nd class had an amazing 95% of survival.<br><br>
